# BIOA: Batch Image Overlay Adder
This script allows you to add transparent images on top of another image. Uses FFMPEG to process image.

## Background story
~~Maybe you shouldn't read it and get into the next step~~
One time, when I was shopping at Shopee, then I think about: How they actually put the same watermark / overlay graphics on an image while it's time consuming?

# WIP
Stay tuned.
